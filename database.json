        "The hydra is a simple creature. Less than half an inch long, its tubular body has a foot at one end and a mouth at the other. The foot clings to a surface underwater — a plant or a rock, perhaps — and the mouth, ringed with tentacles, ensnares passing water fleas. It does not have a brain, or even much of a nervous system. And yet, new research shows, it sleeps. Studies by a team in South Korea and Japan showed that the hydra periodically drops into a rest state that meets the essential criteria for sleep. On the face of it, that might seem improbable. For more than a century, researchers who study sleep have looked for its purpose and structure in the brain. They have explored sleep’s connections to memory and learning. They have numbered the neural circuits that push us down into oblivious slumber and pull us back out of it. They have recorded the telltale changes in brain waves that mark our passage through different stages of sleep and tried to understand what drives them. Mountains of research and people’s daily experience attest to human sleep’s connection to the brain.",
        "In a pair of advisories, the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and its Financial Crimes Enforcement Network warned that facilitators could be prosecuted even if they or the victims did not know that the hackers demanding the ransom were subject to U.S. sanctions. Ransomware works by encrypting computers, holding a company’s data hostage until a payment is made. Organizations have often ponied up ransoms to liberate their data. “It is a game changer,” said Alon Gal, chief technology officer of Hudson Rock, which works to head off ransomware attacks before they happen. Before, companies could decide whether or not to pay cybercriminals off, he said. Now that those decisions are being brought under government oversight 'we are going to see a much tougher handling of these incidents.'The Enforcement Network’s advisory also warned that cybersecurity firms may need to register as money services businesses if they help make ransomware payments. That would impose a new reporting requirement on a previously little-regulated corner of the cybersecurity industry. Ransomware has become an increasingly visible threat in the United States and abroad. Cybercriminals have long used the software to loot their victims. Some countries, notably North Korea, are also accused of deploying ransomware to earn cash.",
        "One of the best ways to find ways to improve performance, we’ve found, is to work closely with our customers. We love shared troubleshooting sessions with their own engineering teams to find and eliminate bottlenecks. In one of these, we found a discrepancy in upload speeds between Windows and Linux. We then worked with the Windows Core TCP team to triage the problem, find workarounds, and eventually fix it. The issue turned out to be in the interaction between the Windows TCP stack and firmware on the Network Interface Controllers (NIC) we use on our Edge servers. As a result, Microsoft improved the Windows implementation of the TCP RACK-TLP algorithm and its resilience to packet reordering. This is now fixed and available starting with Windows 10 build 21332 through the Windows Insider Program dev channel. How we got there is an interesting and instructive tale—we learned that Windows has some tracing tools beyond our Linux-centric experience, and working with Microsoft engineers led to both a quick workaround for our users and a long-term fix from Microsoft. Teamwork! We hope our story inspires others to collaborate across companies to improve their own users’ experiences.",
        "Every one of us at PlanetScale is deeply unsatisfied by the current state of “modern” databases. We’ve worked at companies like YouTube, Amazon, Facebook, DigitalOcean, and GitHub, always focused on solving the same problem — database scaling.We’ve seen the same sad pattern repeat year after year. Companies pick a stack on day 1 that optimizes for developer velocity to get that MVP out the door. After they see some success, years 3 or 4 are spent paying down immense technical debt — mostly due to that early database choice. There needs to be a better wayPlanetScale’s technologies have been the choice of the hyperscalers for years. We’ve seen some of the largest web services in the world make Vitess their database of choice, scaling beyond imaginationThe world is full of hosted databases that don’t have much more to offer. The state of the art isn’t really that good. At PlanetScale we hold the belief that databases should have power and flexibility that make development joyful, along with the confidence that you’ll never outgrow it.Today we are thrilled to announce PlanetScale — the database for developers.",
        "Australian Hyundai rally driver Brendan Reeves is the man behind the latest record, having driven a production-spec Nexo from the Essendon Fields in MelbournAfter 807km of efficiency-focused driving, Reeves arrived in Broken Hill with plenty range still showing on the vehicle’s trip computer.The journey then continued to Silverton, an outback town on the outskirts of Broken Hill, best known as the setting for 1980s post-apocalyptic action film Mad Max 2, and the car then travelled some 60km beyond before the Nexo’s hydrogen tank was depleted on the Wilangee road beyond Eldee Station.During the trip the Nexo consumed a total of 6.27kg of hydrogen, at a rate of 0.706kg/100km. It purified 449,100 litres of air on the journey – enough for 33 adults to breathe in a day.According to Hyundai, the trip took 13 hours and six minutes at an average speed of 66.9km/h. The Nexo’s low fuel warning first lit up at 686km, with over 200km of range left from that point.The fuel light started flashing after 796km, with 90km of real range remaining.A representative from the RACV was on hand to seal the Nexo’s tank at the start of the journey, and an NRMA representative confirmed the validity of the tank seal at the end.Commenting on the achievement Reeves, said, 'Being a rally driver, I’ve always wanted to achieve a world record, but I could never have guessed it would come about this way.",
        "Most people think of nerds as quiet, diffident people. In ordinary social situations they are — as quiet and diffident as the star quarterback would be if he found himself in the middle of a physics symposium. And for the same reason: they are fish out of water. But the apparent diffidence of nerds is an illusion due to the fact that when non-nerds observe them, it's usually in ordinary social situations. In fact some nerds are quite fiercThe fierce nerds are a small but interesting group. They are as a rule extremely competitive — more competitive, I'd say, than highly competitive non-nerds. Competition is more personal for them. Partly perhaps because they're not emotionally mature enough to distance themselves from it, but also because there's less randomness in the kinds of competition they engage in, and they are thus more justified in taking the results personally.Fierce nerds also tend to be somewhat overconfident, especially when young. It might seem like it would be a disadvantage to be mistaken about one's abilities, but empirically it isn't. Up to a point, confidence is a self-fullfilling prophecy.",

        "Ethereum will be completing the transition to Proof-of-Stake in the upcoming months, which brings a myriad of improvements that have been theorized for years. But now that the Beacon chain has been running for a few months, we can actually dig into the numbers. One area that we’re excited to explore involves new energy-use estimates, as we end the process of expending a country’s worth of energy on consensThere aren’t any concrete statistics on energy consumption (or even what hardware is used) as of yet, so what follows is a ball-park estimation of the energy consumption of the future of EthereumAs many people are running multiple validators, I’ve decided to use the number of unique addresses that made deposits as a proxy for how many servers are out there today. Many stakers could have used multiple eth1 addresses, but this largely cancels out against those with redundant setupsAt the time of writing, there are 140,592 validators from 16,405 unique addresses. Obviously this is heavily skewed by exchanges and staking services, so removing them leaves 87,897 validators assumed to be staking from home. As a sanity check, this implies that the average home-staker runs 5.4 validators which seems like a reasonable estimate to me.",
        "We've always had a soft spot for language at Google. Early on, we set out to translate the web. More recently, we’ve invented machine learning techniques that help us better grasp the intent of Search queries. Over time, our advances in these and other areas have made it easier and easier to organize and access the heaps of information conveyed by the written and spoken wordBut there’s always room for improvement. Language is remarkably nuanced and adaptable. It can be literal or figurative, flowery or plain, inventive or informational. That versatility makes language one of humanity’s greatest tools — and one of computer science’s most difficult puzzles.LaMDA, our latest research breakthrough, adds pieces to one of the most tantalizing sections of that puzzle: conversation",
        "Running queries on Uber’s data platform lets us make data-driven decisions at every level, from forecasting rider demand during high traffic events to identifying and addressing bottlenecks in the driver sign-up process. Our Apache Hadoop-based data platform ingests hundreds of petabytes of analytical data with minimum latency and stores it in a data lake built on top of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)Our data platform leverages several open source projects (Apache Hive, Apache Presto, and Apache Spark) for both interactive and long running queries, serving the myriad needs of different teams at Uber. All of these services were built in Java or Scala and run on open source Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  Uber’s growth over the last few years exponentially increased both the volume of data and the associated access loads required to process it, resulting in much more memory consumption from services. Increased memory consumption exposed a variety of issues, including long garbage collection (GC) pauses, memory corruption, out-of-memory (OOM) exceptions, and memory leaks. "
